            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Wildlife photography is a genre of photography concerned with
                documenting various forms of wildlife in their natural habitat.

                As well as requiring photography skills, wildlife photographers may need field craft skills. For
                example, some animals and birds are difficult to approach and thus a knowledge of the animal's and birds
                behavior is needed in order to be able to predict its actions. Photographing some species may require
                stalking skills or the use of a hide/blind for concealment</p><br>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">While wildlife photographs can be taken using basic equipment,
                successful photography of some types of wildlife requires specialist equipment, such as macro lenses for
                insects, long focal length lenses for birds and underwater cameras for marine life. However, a great
                wildlife photograph can also be the result of being in the right place at the right time[1] and often
                involves a good understanding of animal behavior in order to anticipate interesting situations to
                capture in photography.</p>
